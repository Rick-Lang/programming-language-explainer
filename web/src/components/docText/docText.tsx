        <h2>What is a Convolutional Neural Network?</h2>
        <p>In machine learning, a classifier assigns a class label to a data point. For example, an image classifier produces a class label (e.g, bird, plane) for what objects exist within an image. A convolutional neural network, or CNN for short, is a type of classifier, which excels at solving this problem!</p>
